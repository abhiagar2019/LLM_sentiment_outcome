Customer Service Transcript Sentiment and Outcome Analyzer

This project provides a Python script that leverages Opensource Model (for sentiment analysis) and OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o-mini API (for sentiment analysis and outcome detection) to analyze customer service transcripts. The tool reads transcripts from .txt files and determines the sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) of the customer ("member") and whether the issue was resolved or requires a follow-up.
Key Steps:
1.	Setup: Install required dependencies (transformers and OpenAI) and set up the OpenAI API key (paid).
2.	Reading Transcripts: The script reads .txt files from a specified directory containing customer service transcripts.
3.	API Integration: Each transcript is processed using the GPT-4o-mini model to analyze sentiment and outcome.
4.	Results: Sentiment and outcome data are saved into a CSV file for further analysis.

This tool helps businesses efficiently analyze customer interactions, allowing them to measure customer satisfaction and monitor unresolved issues.
